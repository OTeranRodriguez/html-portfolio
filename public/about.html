<h2>My biography</h2>

<p>
  Born and raised in Mexico City, my dear mom alone was in charge of me and my two siblings, so we struggled quite a bit, eventhough we never lacked anything, as we always had food shelter and education (so grateful for that). I grew up thinking that life is a mess, but worth living, so tried to squeeze all the juice from it. <br />
  When I was just a boy I discovered the experience of the cello, and got in love with that and it taught me to work hard and focused to improve my skills. Music has taught me so many things, like team work, discipline, focusing, etc. <br />
  Then, I was introduced to science, specifically chemistry and biology, and it was such a mind blow to just unveil some aspects of nature, reality and existence.
  I love living! And will keep discovering new experiences until God stops me.
