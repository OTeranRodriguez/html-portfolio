<h2>My Top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>John Wick 4</h3>
<p>John Wick 4 is just a piece of art, it has the perfect amount of violence combined with actual art, talking about color and photography composition, dance, camera movement, etc. IT IS A MUST!</p>
<h3>Puss in boots: The Last Wish </h3>
<p>The animation technique is stunning. Also, it is very funny and the story is engaging.</p>
<h3>Parasite</h3>
<p>It has very engaging plot with tense situations that you thought it couldn't go worse</p>
